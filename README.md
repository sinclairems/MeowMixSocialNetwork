For cat lovers to post all of their favorite cat thoughts and pictures. 

As you can see from the video, I didn't get the full functionality of the app to work. There is a bug somewhere that I need to find, but for purposes of turning it in on time, here it is! 

Check out the files, and let me know what you think.

## Technologies Used
  - express.js
  - mongoose

  ## Future Development
In the future I would add a front end with a lot of cat pic and videos. Speaking of pics and videos, I would add a feature that allows users to upload their own cat pics and videos.
